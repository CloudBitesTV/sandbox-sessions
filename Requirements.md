# Requirements

As a user
I would like to see the total number of open tasks against an Account
So that I can identify those Accounts that need a greater amount of focus from the team

Acceptance Criteria:
- When a new open task is added to the Account, the number of open tasks should increase by 1
- When a task is updated to be closed, the number of open tasks should decrement
- When a task is deleted, the number of open tasks should decrement
